The _iframe-resizer_ library has been designed to be a zero impact guest on third party or client websites.
This page guides you through how to setup _iframe-resizer_ in a way that allows you to control how the library
runs after it has been included on another parties website.

## Parent Page

### Create Script
The recommended approach is to host a JS file on your site, based on the following example javascript. 
This code will create your iframe, then load and configure _iframe-resizer_.

<Code lang="ts" title="load-iframe.js" code={loader} />

This approach simplifies the setup for your client sites and allows you to control the version of 
_iframe-resizer_ in use on both the parent and child pages in the future.

It is recommend that you minify this code using either [Terser](https://terser.org/) or 
[UglifyJS](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/).

### Include Script

Once you have deployed the above script to your server, you can then ask external client websites
to simply include the following on their page, at the location they wish to place the iframe.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="HTML">
```html
<script async src="https://your-domain.com/load-iframe.js">
```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
 This will then create the iframe and configure _iframe-resizer_ on their page.

## Child Page

When displaying a third party iframe on your own site. You just need to ask the provider to include the child package 
anywhere on each of their webpages that you are displaying in your iframe. This can be either from your website, or 
_jsDeliver_. Self hosting this script has the advantage that you can upgrade to a future version without having to
have the other party make changes to their site.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="HTML">
```html
<script
  async  
  src="https://your-site.com/node_modules/@iframe-resizer/child/index.umd.js"
></script>
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="jsDeliver CDN">
<Code code={`
<script
  async
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@iframe-resizer/child@${VERSION}"
></script>
`} lang="html" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

The child package is designed to be a good guest on the sites that host it. As such it will not initialize until
having first received a message from the parent page.
