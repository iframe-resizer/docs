This page guides you through how to setup _iframe-resizer_ in a way that allows you to control how the library
runs after it has been included on another party's website. You can use _iframe-resizer_ to either include
third party content on your own site, or share you content in an iframe on other parties sites.

## Sharing an iframe with third parties

This is a quick setup guide that details how to create a simple javascript file that you can share with
third parties that wish to include you iframe on their own sites. 

This approach simplifies the setup for your client sites and allows you to control the version of _iframe-resizer_ 
in use on both the parent and child pages in the future, without having to go back to your clients and ask them to
 make changes to their sites.

### License

Set the license key in your pages displayed in the iframe. This will need to be included alongside the
[child page](/setup/child) javascript file.

```js
window.iframeResizer = { license: 'xxxx' }
```

### Create setup script
This code will create your iframe with the link to your content, then load and configure _iframe-resizer_.

<Code lang="ts" title="load-iframe.js" code={loader} />

It is recommend that you minify this code using either [Terser](https://terser.org/) or 
[UglifyJS](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/).

### Share the script

Once you have deployed the above script to your server, you can then ask external client websites
to simply include the following on their page, at the location they wish to place the iframe.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="HTML">
```html
<script async src="https://your-domain.com/load-iframe.js">
```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
 This will then create the iframe and configure _iframe-resizer_ on their page.

## Include third party content on your site

When displaying a third party iframe on your own site. You just need to ask the provider to include the child package 
anywhere on each of their webpages that you are displaying in your iframe. 

### Create setup script
This code will create your iframe with the link to your content, then load and configure _iframe-resizer_.

<Code lang="ts" title="include-iframe.js" code={include} />

### Share the script

Once you have deployed the above script to your server, you can then ask external client websites
to simply include the following on their page, at the location they wish to place the iframe.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="HTML">
```html
<script async src="https://your-domain.com/guest-iframe.js">
```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

The child package is designed to be a good guest on the sites that host it. As such it will not initialize until
having first received a message from the parent page.
