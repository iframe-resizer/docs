Creating a resizable iframe for use on third party or client website is a common use case for _iframe-resizer_.

#### Create Script
The recommended approach is to host a JS file on your site, based on the following example javascript. This code will create your iframe and then configure _iframe-resizer_.

<Code lang="ts" title="load-iframe.js" code={loader} />

This approach simplifies the setup for your client sites and allows you to control the version of 
_iframe-resizer_ in use on both the parent and child pages in the future.

It is recommend that you minify this code using either [Terser](https://terser.org/) or 
[UglifyJS](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/).

#### Include Script

Once you have deployed the above script to your server, you can then ask external client websites to simply include the following on their page, at the location they wish to place the iframe.

```html
<script async src="https://your-domain.com/load-iframe.js">
```
 This will then create the iframe and configure _iframe-resizer_ on their page.

<FeedbackComponent />
