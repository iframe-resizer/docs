The child page needs to load its own JavaScript package into the iframe, in order to enable communication
with the [parent page](/setup/parent). The **@iframe-resizer/child** package is a small self-contained
script. It is designed to be a good guest on someone else's site and will only start running after receiving
a message from the parent page.

## Install

Download and install the child page package with one of the following options..

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/child" download cdn/>

## Usage

This package just needs to be included on every page that you load into the iframe.
Where it will quietly listen for a message from the parent page, before initializing
itself.

<Tabs syncKey="version">
  <TabItem label="Vanilla JS">
```html
<script
  async
  src="/node_modules/@iframe-resizer/child/index.umd.js"
></script>
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="ES Modules">
```js
import '@iframe-resizer/child'

  <TabItem label="Common JS">

require('@iframe-resizer/child')
```

></script>
`} lang="html" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

Once everything is set up, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _iframe-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Advanced Setup](/setup/advanced/) and [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.

#### License

If your iframe is designed to be hosted by third parties, then you can alternatively set the license key
on the child page. This will also need to be included on every page hosted in your iframe.

<Code lang="ts" title="config.js" code={config} />

## API

The [Child Page API](/api/child) includes a range of settings, events and methods to 
enable you to securely interact with both _iframe-resizer_ and the child page.
