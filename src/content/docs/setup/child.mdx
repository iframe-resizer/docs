The child page needs to load it's own JavaScript package into the iframe, in order to enable communication
with the [parent page](/setup/parent). The **@iframe-resizer/child** package is a small self-contained
script with no dependencies. It is designed to be a good guest on someone else site
and will only start running after receiving a message from the parent page.

## Install

Download and install the child page package with one of the following options..

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/child" download cdn/>

## Usage

This package just needs to be included on every page that you load into the iframe.
Where it will quietly listen for a message from the parent page, before initializing
itself.

Once everything is setup, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _iframe-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Performance](/performance) and [Trouble Shooting](/troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.

## API

The [Child Page API](/api/child) includes a range of settings, events and methods to 
enable you to securely interact with both _iframe-resizer_ and the parent page.
