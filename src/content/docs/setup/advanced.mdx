On most pages _iframe-resizer_ is able to detect changes in the iframe, recalculate
the page size and adjust the iframe in sub millisecond time. In a few rare edge cases,
it might need a little help.

## Custom page size

The following options allow you to adjust how the content size is calculated by 
targeting which page elements are used in the calculations and then adjusting 
the returned value.

### <span class="option">data-iframe-size</span>

By adding a `data-iframe-size` attribute to any HTML element on the page, you can tell
_iframe-resizer_ to use that element to calculate the page size. Where there is more
than one element with this attribute, the element with the largest value will be
used.

### <span class="option">sizeSelector</span>

This option can be set via the [Child Page API settings](/api/child#settings)
and allows you to use a CSS Selector to add the `data-iframe-size` attribute
to elements on the page. When the page content changes, this will be rerun to
ensure this setting remains up to date.

### <span class="option">offsetSize</span>

Available in both the Parent and Child pages, this option allows you to adjust
the calculated page size. It can be used with either a positive or negative value.

### <span class="option">onBeforeResize()</span>

The `onBeforeResize(newSize)` event allows you to modify or replace the content
size value, before it is sent to the parent page.

## Ignoring page elements

Occasionally it can be useful to ignore page elements from the page size calculation.
The most common use cases for this are Overlays and Modal Backdrops.

### <span class="option">data-iframe-ignore</span>

Adding a `data-iframe-ignore` attribute to any HTML element on the page, will remove
that element and all its descendants from the <span class="fig">Set</span> of overflown 
elements that have their size monitored by _iframe-resizer_.

### <span class="option">ignoreSelector</span>

This option can be set via the [Child Page API settings](/api/child#settings)
and allows you to use a CSS Selector to add the `data-iframe-ignore` attribute
to elements on the page. When the page content changes, this will be rerun to
ensure this setting remains up to date.

## Performance

If _iframe-resizer_ gives you a warning about performance, then the first two
options above can also be used to limit the total number of page elements that
require inspection to calculate the page size. This will greatly improve 
performance on pages where you have a lot of content that has overflown the
root document element.
