On most pages _iframe-resizer_ is able to detect changes in the iframe, recalculate
the page size and adjust the iframe in sub nanosecond time. In a few rare edge cases,
it might need a little help.

## Custom page size

The following three options allow you to adjust how the content size is calculated by targeting
which page elements are used in the calculations and then adjusting the returned value.

### <span class="option">data-iframe-size</span>

By adding a `data-iframe-size` attribute to any HTML element on the page, you can tell
_iframe-resizer_ to use that element to calculate the page size. Where their is more
than one element with the attribute, then the element with the largest value will be
used.

### <span class="option">sizeSelector</span>

This option can be set via the [Child Page API settings](/api/child#settings)
and allows you to use a CSS Selector to add the `data-iframe-size` attribute
to elements on the page. When the page content changes, this will be rerun to
ensure this setting remains up to date.

### <span class="option">offsetSize</span>

Available in both the Parent and Child pages, this option allows you to adjust the
calculated page size. It can be provide with a positive or negative value.

## Performance

If _iframe-resizer_ gives you a warning about performance, then the first two
options above can also be used to limit the total number of page elements that
require inspection to calculate the page size. This will greatly improve 
performance on pages where you have a lot of content that has overflowed the
root document element.
