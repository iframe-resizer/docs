The _iframe-resizer_ library is available with either a 
Commercial License, or an Open Source License.

## Commercial License

If you want to use _iframe-resizer_ on non-open-sourced sites, themes, projects, and/or 
applications, the Commercial License is the appropriate license. 

With this option, your source code is kept proprietary. This means you can keep your
application source code proprietary without needing to adopt an open-source license.

## Open-Source License

If you are creating an open source project under a license compatible with the GNU General 
Public License version 3 (GPL v3), then you may use _iframe-resizer_ under the terms of the 
GPL v3 license.

You will have to provide a prominent notice that _iframe-resizer_ is in use. The credit 
comments in the JavaScript files should be kept intact (even after combination or minification).
