On most pages _iframe-resizer_ is able to detect changes in the iframe, recalculate
the page size and adjust the iframe in sub nanosecond time. The time it takes to
recalculate the size of the iframe is monitored by _iframe-resizer_ and unless it
tells you it has detected an issue with your page content, you can skip the rest
of this page.

## Content outside of the body element

<Aside type="note" title="">
  Version 5.2 onwards of **_iframe-resizer_** includes a newer size detection algorithm that
  greatly improves the performance of the page size calculations with overflowing content. 
  If you are on an older version you should upgrade before implementing the advise below.
</Aside>

By default _iframe-resizer_ uses the size of the `<html>` element to calculate the size
of the iframe's content. However, if there are page elements, that due to CSS
cause content to not be fully contained within the root document element, then this can 
lead to the `<html>` element to not correctly reflect the iframe's content size.

To overcome this, _iframe-resizer_ maintains a realtime [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
of page element that don't 100% intersect with the root document element by using the
[intersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
browser API. This set of non-intersecting elements is then used to check the overall content size.

In the unlikely event that you have a large number of overflowing or not fully intersecting elements
on the page, it may take an few milliseconds to calculate the page size. In this situation you have
two options to improve performance.

1. Adjust CSS and page design to keep most page elements inside of the `<body>` element.

2. Explicitly designate which page element should be used to track the page size, by directly 
   adding a `data-iframe-size` attribute or using the [sizeSelector](/api/child#sizeselector) 
   option to specify the elements to be used for sizing the content. 
   
   With both methods you can specify multiple elements and the one that returns the highest 
   value will be used each time the page size is calculated. However, these should be used 
   sparingly, as the more elements selected on the page, the greater the amount of work 
   required to calculate the page size. 
   
   It may also be useful to set the [offsetSize](/api/parent#offsetSize) option, which allows
   the adjustment of the returned size value from the iframe.

If _iframe-resizer_ detects page content is having an excessive impact on performance,
it will log a warning to the browser console to advise you to add a `data-iframe-size` to an
element on your page.
