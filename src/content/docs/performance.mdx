On most pages _iframe-resizer_ is able to detect changes in the iframe, recalculate
the page size and adjust the iframe in sub nanosecond time. This page details the one
of situation that can impact performance and how to mitigate it.

## Content outside of the body element

By default _iframe-resizer_ uses the size of the `<body/>` element to calculate the size
of the iframe's content. However, if it detects that there is content outside of the body,
then _iframe-resizer_ will fall back to checking the position of every visible element on
the page.

In some cases, such as anchoring content to the base of the iframe, this can prevent the
iframe from downsizing, as the content is now bound to the size of the window, rather
than the content.

To address the issues raised by content overflow, you have two options.

1. Adjust CSS and page design to keep all elements inside of the body element.

2. Explicitly designate which page element should be used to track the page size, by directly 
   adding a `data-iframe-size` attribute or using the [sizeSelector](/api/child#sizeselector) 
   option to specify the elements to be used for sizing the content. 
   
   With both methods you can specify multiple elements and the one that returns the highest 
   value will be used each time the page size is calculated. However, these should be used 
   sparingly, as the more elements selected on the page, the greater the amount of work 
   required to calculate the page size. 
   
   It may also be useful to set the [offsetSize](/api/parent#offsetSize) option, which allows
   the adjustment of the returned size value from the iframe.

If _iframe-resizer_ detects content overflow is having an excessive impact on performance,
it will log a warning to the browser console to advise you to add a `data-iframe-size` to an
element on your page.
