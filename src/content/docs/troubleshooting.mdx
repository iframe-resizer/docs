The first steps to investigate any problem is to make sure you are using the latest version and then check the 
[JavaScript Console](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console#opening_the_console). _iframe-resizer_
will output the details of any issues it detects and give advise on how to fix them.

Solutions for the most common problems are outlined in this section. If you need further help, then please ask questions on
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/iframe-resizer) with the `iframe-resizer` tag.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/issues).
Please read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before opening a ticket, as this will ensure a faster resolution.

### IFrame not resizing

The most common cause of this is not placing the [@iframe-resizer/child](/setup/child) package inside the iframed page. If 
this does not fix the problem then check `x-Frame-Options` http header on the server that is sending the iframe content, as 
this can also block `postMessage` calls from _iframe-resizer_ if set incorrectly.

### Iframe not downsizing

There are a few different things that can cause the iframe to have difficulty downsizing when the content changes,
the most common issues are caused by either having the browser fallback to the legacy 
[Quirks Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode) or a couple of 
different CSS pattens that don't translate into a dynamically resizing webpage.

#### Quirks Mode

When the browser enters Quirks Mode it is unable to reliably update the size of containing elements, when the
content in the page changes. This can prevent _iframe-resizer_ from correctly detecting that the page size has
changed. To ensure you page is running in the modern Standards Mode, you should ensure it has the following 
doctype and that the HTML is [valid](https://validator.w3.org/).

```html
<!doctype html>
```

#### CSS 

Their are two CSS pattens that should be avoided in the iframe, as they will prevent the page size shrinking
when changes are made to the content, of the window is resized. The first is having **absolutely positioned 
elements anchored to the bottom of the page**, and the second is using **Viewport / Percentage Sizing Units 
on the same axes that _iframe-resizer_ is controlling**. The [Iframe Content Guidelines](/content_guidelines) 
section explains both of these issues and how to mitigate them.

To find out which element on the page is causing the issue, you can enable the `log` option and it will output
the HTML element being used to calculate the page size to the browser console, each time the page updates.

```js
iframeResize({ log: true })
```

If for some reason you are unable to fix the CSS on the page, as a fallback you can manually select which page 
element to use for page size calculation with the `data-iframe-size` attribute. The 
[Advanced Setup](/setup/advanced) guide explains the different ways that this can be applied to the page.

### Multiple IFrames on one page

When the resizer does not work using multiple IFrames on one page, make sure that each iframe has a unique id.

### Localhost 127.0.0.1 and file:///

When an iframe is located on your local machine the browser adds extra security restrictions to cross-domain iframes. 
These can stop _iframe-resizer_ from functioning. If you need to test something locally, then it is best to use the 
external IP Address of the machine.

### Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow'

This error occurs when the parent window tries to send a message to the iframe before it has loaded. This library makes 
multiple attempts to talk to the iframe, so if everything is working then you can safely ignore this error message.

If you're still having problems, or you really want to not ignore the error, then you can try delaying the call to `iframeResize()` 
until after the iframe onload event has been triggered, by setting the `waitForLoad` option to **true**.

```js
iframeResize({ waitForLoad: true })
```

### Iframe has not responded within 5 seconds

This error happens when the iframe is slow to respond, or is blocked from responding to the request from the parent page.

If everything is working, then this message can be ignored, or if you prefer you can set a longer timeout. On the other hand 
if you are not getting a response and the child package has been loaded in the iframe, then you need to check that iframe has 
not been sandboxed, either by setting options on the `<iframe>` tag, or with the `x-Frame-Options` http header of the iframe.

### ParentIframe not found errors

The `parentIframe` object is created once the iframe has been initially resized. If you wish to use it during page load you 
will need call it from the [onReady()](/api/child#onready) startup event handler.

```html
<script>
  window.iframeResizer = {
    onReady() {
      const myId = window.parentIframe.getId()
      console.log("The ID of the iframe in the parent page is: " + myId)
    },
  }
</script>
```

### Scrolling does not scroll to where I want it

The scrolling events in _iframe-resizer_ aim to mimic how they work by default in the parent page. If this
is not the behavior that you want, then you can use the [onScroll](/api/parent#onscroll) event handler in
the Parent Page API to adjust how scrolling works to you own requirements.

### PDF and OpenDocument files

It is not possible to add the required JavaScript to PDF and ODF files. However, you can get around this limitation 
by using [ViewerJS](http://viewerjs.org) to render these files inside a HTML page, that also contains the iframe 
[@iframe-resizer/child](/setup/child) package.

### Unexpected message received error

By default the origin of incoming messages is checked against the `src` attribute of the iframe. If they don't match 
an error is thrown. This behavior can be disabled by setting the [checkOrigin](/api/parent#checkorigin) option to **false**.

```js
iframeResize({ checkOrigin: false })
```

### Width not resizing

By default only changes in height are detected, if you want to calculate the width instead then you need to set the 
[direction](/api/parent#direction) option to **'horizontal'**.

```js
iframeResize({ direction: "horizontal" })
```
