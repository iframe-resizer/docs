The _iframe-resizer_ library aims to take away the pain points with using iframes. 
It will resize your iframe to match the size of your content and then monitor the 
iframe to ensure that it is always the perfect size.

As browsers don't provide a single consistently reliable method to calculate content
size, _iframe-resizer_ automatically inspects your page and selects the best value
for your content every time it detects something changed.

Supports both internal (same-domain) and external (cross-domain) iframes via a simple
JS file that is designed to be a zero impact guest on the sites hosting it.

Additionally _iframe-resizer_  provides a range of missing browser API features, that
allows you to securely integrate your iframe content with the parent page.

- Scroll the page, relative to the iframe or parent page's position
- Get details of the position of the iframe, the scroll position and viewport of the parent page
- Fixes in page linking in the iframe and allows links to propagate to the parent page
- Adds `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events to the iframe element
- Simplified message passing between the iframe and the parent page
- Automatic domain authentication

When combined with [viewer.js](https://viewerjs.org) it can even resize iframes 
containing PDF and ODF documents.

## Version 5

This version of _iframe-resizer_ has been extensively rewritten to use modern browser APIs,
this has enabled significantly better performance and greater accuracy in the detection of
content resizing events.

With this release, the opportunity has been taken to refresh and simplify the API, if you
are coming from a previous version then there is an [Upgrade Guide](/upgrade) to explain 
the changes.
