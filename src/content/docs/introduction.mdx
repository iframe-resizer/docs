The _iframe-resizer_ library aims to take away the pain points with using iframes. 
It will resize your iframe to match the size of your content and then monitor the 
iframe to ensure that it is always the perfect size.

### Reliable Resizing

As browsers don't provide a single consistently reliable method to calculate content
size, _iframe-resizer_ automatically inspects your page and selects the best value
for your content every time it detects something changed.

### High Performance

To ensure minimal impact on your site, _iframe-resizer_ is highly optimised and 
utilizes [Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) to ensure it only
checks the page elements that effect the sizing of your iframes. 

Even on the most complex pages, _iframe-resizer_ can detect changes to both HTML 
and CSS, calculate the revised content dimensions and update the iframe in sub 
millisecond time.

### Cross Domain

Supports both internal (same-domain) and external (cross-domain) iframes via a simple
JS file that is designed to be a zero impact guest on the sites hosting it.

### Extended API

Additionally _iframe-resizer_  provides a range of missing browser API features, that
allows you to securely integrate your iframe content with the parent page.

- Scroll the parent page, [relative to the iframe](/api/child#scrolltooffsetx-y) or [parent page's position](/api/child#scrollbyx-y)
- Provides details of the [position of the iframe](/api/child#getparentpropscallback), the [scroll position](/api/child#getparentpropscallback) and [viewport](/api/child#getparentpropscallback) of the parent page
- Fixes [in page linking](/api/parent#inpagelinks) in the iframe and allows links to propagate to the parent page
- Adds [`onMouseEnter`](/api/parent#onmouseenter) and [`onMouseLeave`](/api/parent#onmouseleave) events to the iframe element
- Simplified message passing between the [iframe](/api/child#onmessage) and the [parent](/api/parent#onmessage) page
- Automatic domain authentication
- Enhanced [Accessibility](/accessibility)

When combined with [viewer.js](https://viewerjs.org) it can even resize iframes 
containing PDF and ODF documents.

## Version 5

This version of _iframe-resizer_ has been extensively rewritten to use modern browser APIs,
this has enabled significantly better performance and greater accuracy in the detection of
content resizing events.

With this release, the opportunity has been taken to refresh and simplify the API, if you
are coming from a previous version then there is an [Upgrade Guide](/upgrade) to explain 
the changes.
