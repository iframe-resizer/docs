The _iframe-resizer_ project is comprised of separate JS files for the parent and child pages.
This guide takes you through setting up the parent and then child pages in WordPress.

## Install

Download the latest version of  <a href="https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/raw/master/iframe-resizer.zip">iframe-resizer.zip</a>.
This contains three JavaScript files, for the parent page you can choose between the vanilla JS (<b>iframe-resizer.parent.js</b>) 
 and jQuery (<b>iframe-resizer.jquery.js</b>) versions. Finally the third file (<b>iframe-resizer.child.js</b>)
needs placing in every page shown in your iframe.

You then need to upload these files to `/wp-admin/js` on your WordPress server and ensure they have public read access.

## Parent Page

In this section we detail how to setup the parent page.

### Usage

The normal configuration is to have the iframe resize when
the browser window changes size or the content of the iframe
changes. To set this up you need to configure one of the
dimensions of the iframe to a percentage and tell the library
to only update the other dimension. Normally you would set the
width to 100% and have the height scale to fit the content.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Vanilla JS">
```html
<style>
  iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  }
</style>

<iframe id="myIframe" src="http://anotherdomain.com/iframe.html"></iframe>

<script src="/wp-admin/js/iframe-resizer.parent.js"></script>
<script>
  iframeResize({ 
    license: 'xxxx',
    log: 'collapsed',
    waitForLoad: true,
  }, '#myIframe');
</script>
```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="jQuery">
```html
<style>
  iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  }
</style>

<iframe id="myIframe" src="http://anotherdomain.com/iframe.html"></iframe>

<script src="/wp-admin/js/iframe-resizer.jquery.js"></script>
<script>
  $('#myIframe').iframeResize({ license: "xxxx", waitForLoad: true });
</script>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

Setting the initial height of the iframe to `100vh` makes the loading in of
the iframe appear smoother to the user, as they will only see the content
below the iframe once it has completed loading and undergone it's initial
sizing.

The `waitForLoad` option defers sending a message to the iframe until after
the `onload` event fires on the iframe. If their is any possibility that the
iframe content could load before the JavaScript runs, then you should set 
this option to **false**.

## Child Page

The child page needs to load it's own JavaScript package, to enable communication
with the parent page. This is a small self-contained script with no dependencies.
It is designed to be a good guest on someone else site and will only start running
after receiving a message from the parent page.

### Usage

The following line then needs to be added to every page shown in the iframe.

```html
<script src="/wp-admin/js/iframe-resizer.child.js"></script>
```

Once everything is setup, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _iframe-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Advanced Setup](/setup/advanced/) and [Trouble Shooting](/troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.
