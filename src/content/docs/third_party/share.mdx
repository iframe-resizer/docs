import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { Code } from 'astro-expressive-code/components'

import FeedbackComponent from "/src/components/Feelback.astro"
import loader from '/src/assets/third-party/load-iframe.js?raw'
import config from '/src/assets/third-party/config.js?raw'

This is a quick setup guide that details how to create a simple JavaScript file that you can share with
third parties that wish to include your iframe on their own sites. 

This approach simplifies the setup for your client sites and allows you to control the version of _iframe-resizer_ 
in use on both the parent and child pages in the future, without having to go back to your clients and ask them to
 make changes to their sites.

### License

The license can be provided by either party. Via the parent page page, or if you have a Business / OEM license 
on the child page. Only one license is needed to cover both sites.

To set the _License Key_ in the iframe, it can be added alongside any other _Settings_ and _Events_ you wish 
to use from the [Child Page API](/api/child).  This will need to be included alongside the
[child page](/setup/child) JavaScript file on every page you display in the iframe.

<Code lang="ts" title="config.js" code={config} />

### Create a setup script
This code will create your iframe with the link to your content, then load and configure _iframe-resizer_.

<Code lang="ts" title="load-iframe.js" code={loader} />

It is recommend that you minify this code using either [Terser](https://terser.org/) or 
[UglifyJS](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/).

### Share the setup script

Once you have deployed the above script to your server, you can then ask external client websites
to simply include the following on their page, at the location they wish to place the iframe.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="HTML">
```html
<script async src="https://your-domain.com/load-iframe.js">
```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
 This will then create the iframe and configure _iframe-resizer_ on their page.

<FeedbackComponent />
