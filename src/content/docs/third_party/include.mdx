This is a quick setup guide that details how to create a simple JavaScript file that you can share with
third parties that are providing your site with their iframe. 

<Aside type="tip">
  This guide will set up iframe-resizer for use on a single parent page. If the iframe is used by multiple sites,
  then you should instead follow the [Share an iframe](share) guide,
</Aside>

This approach simplifies the setup for your supplier site and allows you to control the version of _iframe-resizer_ 
in use on both the parent and child pages in the future, without having to go back to your supplier and ask them to
 make changes to their site.

When displaying a third-party iframe on your own site, you need to ask the provider to include the following
script on every page they present in the iframe.

### Create a setup script
This code will create your iframe with the link to your content, then load and configure _iframe-resizer_.

<Code lang="ts" title="include-iframe.js" code={include} />

It is recommended that you minify this code using either [Terser](https://terser.org/) or 
[UglifyJS](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/).

### Share the setup script

Once you have deployed the above script to your server, you can then ask external websites
to simply include the following on each page they show in the iframe.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="HTML">
```html
<script async src="https://your-domain.com/include-iframe.js">
```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

Once the script is deployed and included by your third-party providers, their iframes will be ready for
seamless integration onto your site. 

To complete the setup, follow the steps in the [Parent Page](/setup/parent) setup guide. This will
enable communication between the iframe and the parent page, ensuring proper resizing and functionality.

By following this guide, you have created a setup script that simplifies iframe integration for
third-party providers. This approach ensures version control, simplifies future updates, and provides
a seamless experience for your users.
