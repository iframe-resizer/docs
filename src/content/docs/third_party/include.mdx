This is a quick setup guide that details how to create a simple javascript file that you can share with
third parties that are providing your site with their iframe. 

This approach simplifies the setup for your supplier site and allows you to control the version of _iframe-resizer_ 
in use on both the parent and child pages in the future, without having to go back to your supplier and ask them to
 make changes to their site.

When displaying a third party iframe on your own site. You just need to ask the provider to include the following
script on every page they present in the iframe.

### Create a setup script
This code will create your iframe with the link to your content, then load and configure _iframe-resizer_.

<Code lang="ts" title="include-iframe.js" code={include} />

### Share the setup script

Once you have deployed the above script to your server, you can then ask external supplier websites
to simply include the following on their page, at the location they wish to place the iframe.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="HTML">
```html
<script async src="https://your-domain.com/include-iframe.js">
```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

The child package is designed to be a good guest on the sites that host it. As such it will not initialize until
having first received a message from the parent page.
