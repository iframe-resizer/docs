The _iframe-resizer_ project is distributed via separate packages for the parent and
child pages. This guide takes you through setting up the parent and then child pages.

## Parent Page Setup

In this section we detail how to setup the parent page using the Vanilla JavaScript
version of _iframe-resizer_. The [framework](/frameworks/overview) section of this
guide details how to use _iframe-resizer_ with a range of popular frameworks and libraries.

### Install

Download and install the parent page package with one of the following options..

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/parent" cdn download />

### Usage

This library provided the function `iframeResize()` which accepts a config object and one or 
more iframes. Iframes can be passed via either CSS selector or reference. All these values
are optional and if no iframe is provided, then it will bind _iframe-resizer_ to all iframes
currently contained on the page.

```js
const iframes = iframeResize( [{options}], [css selector] || [iframe] )
```

Once the setup has run, an array of the iframes that have had _iframe-resizer_
bound to them is returned.

### Typical setup

The normal configuration is to have the iframe resize when the browser window
changes size or the content of the iframe changes. To set this up you need to
configure one of the dimensions of the iframe to a percentage and tell the
library to only update the other dimension. Normally you would set the width
to 100% and have the height scale to fit the content.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Vanilla JS">
```html
<style>
  iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  }
</style>

<iframe id="myIframe" src="http://anotherdomain.com/iframe.html"></iframe>

<script src="/node_modules/@iframe-resizer/parent/index.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  iframeResize({ 
    license: 'xxxx',
    waitForLoad: true,
  }, '#myIframe' );
</script>
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="ES Modules">
```html
<style>
  iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  }
</style>

<iframe id="myIframe" src="http://anotherdomain.com/iframe.html"></iframe>
```
```js
import iframeResize from '@iframe-resizer/parent'

iframeResize({ license: 'xxxx', waitForLoad: true }, '#myIframe' );

````
</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Common JS">
```html
<style>
  iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  }
</style>

<iframe id="myIframe" src="http://anotherdomain.com/iframe.html"></iframe>
````

```js
const iframeResize = require("@iframe-resizer/parent");

iframeResize({ license: 'xxxx', waitForLoad: true }, '#myIframe' );
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="jsDeliver CDN">
```html
<style>
  iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  }
</style>

<iframe id="myIframe" src="http://anotherdomain.com/iframe.html"></iframe>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@iframe-resizer/parent"></script>
<script>
  iframeResize({ 
    license: 'xxxx',
    waitForLoad: true,
  }, '#myIframe');
</script>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

Setting the initial height of the iframe to `100vh` makes the loading in of
the iframe appear smoother to the user, as they will only see the content
below the iframe once it has completed loading and undergone it's initial
sizing.

The `waitForLoad` option defers sending a message to the iframe until after
the `onload` event fires on the iframe. If their is any possibility that the
iframe content could load before the JavaScript runs, then you should set 
this option to **false**.

### API

The [Parent Page API](/api/parent) includes a range of options, events and methods to 
enable you to securely interact with both _iframe-resizer_ and the child page.


## Child Page Setup

The child page needs to load it's own JavaScript package into the iframe, in order to enable communication
with the [parent page](#parent-page-setup). The **@iframe-resizer/child** package is a small self-contained
script with no dependencies. It is designed to be a good guest on someone else site
and will only start running after receiving a message from the parent page.

### Install

Download and install the child page package with one of the following options..

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/child" download cdn/>

### Usage

This package just needs to be included on every page that you load into the iframe.
Where it will quietly listen for a message from the parent page, before initializing
itself.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Vanilla JS">
```html
<script
  src="/node_modules/@iframe-resizer/child/index.umd.js"
  type="text/javascript"
  async  
></script>
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="ES Modules">
```js
import '@iframe-resizer/child'
```
</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Common JS">
```js
require('@iframe-resizer/child')
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="jsDeliver CDN">
```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@iframe-resizer/child"
  type="text/javascript"
  async
></script>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

Once everything is setup, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _iframe-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Performance](/performance) and [Trouble Shooting](/troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.

### API

The [Child Page API](/api/child) includes a range of settings, events and methods to 
enable you to securely interact with both _iframe-resizer_ and the parent page.
