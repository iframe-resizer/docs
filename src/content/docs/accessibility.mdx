Modern browsers have very good accessibility support for iframes, and this can be further enhanced 
to aid users navigating with assistive technology, such as screen readers, by using the 
[title attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) on an
`<iframe>` to label its contained content.

Having a `title` attribute allows screen readers to announce the purpose of the iframe without 
requiring users to navigate into it. This saves time and reduces confusion, especially on pages 
with multiple `<iframe>` elements or interactive content like video or audio.


### Automated Title Attribute

Where iframes are missing the `title` attribute, _iframe-resizer_ will automatically set it using
the text contained within the `<title>` element of the iframe's content. This ensures the `title`
attribute is always up to date and accurately reflects the page currently displayed within the iframe.

For example:

```html
<!-- Without title -->
<iframe src="example.html"></iframe>

<!-- With title -->
<iframe src="example.html" title="Example Content"></iframe>
```

By automating this process, iframe-resizer ensures that your iframes are accessible without requiring
additional manual effort.
