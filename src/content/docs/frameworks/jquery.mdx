## Install

Download and install this package with one of the following options.

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/jquery" cdn download />

You will also need to ensure that the [@iframe-resizer/child](/setup/child)
package has been loaded into the iframe.

## Usage

Use jQuery to find the iframes on the page and then pass them to the `iframeResize()`
method. The plugin will automatically filter out any non-iframe elements returned
by jQuery.

```js
<style>
  iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  }
</style>
<iframe id="myIframe" src="http://anotherdomain.com/iframe.html"></iframe>
<script src="/node_modules/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/node_modules/iframe-resizer/jquery/index.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  $('iframe').iframeResize({ 
    license: 'xxxx',
    log: 'collapsed',
  })
</script>
```

#### Notes

* You can pass any of the standard Parent API [options](/api/parent#options) and [events](/api/parent#events) via this plugin.

* Setting the initial height of the iframe to `100vh` makes the loading in of the iframe appear smoother to the user, as they will only see the content below the iframe once it has completed loading and undergone it's initial sizing.

## Child page

You will then need to add the [@iframe-resizer/child](/setup/child)
package on the page in the iframe.

Once everything is setup, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _iframe-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Advanced Setup](/setup/advanced/) and [Trouble Shooting](/troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.
