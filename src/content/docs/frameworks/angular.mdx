This guide explains how to create an Angular Directive for _iframe-resizer_ using the [Framework API](/api/framework).

## Install Framework API

Install the core _iframe-resizer_ [Framework API](/api/framework) with the following command.

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/core" />

## Create Angular Directive

Create the following directive, which exposes the full _iframe-resizer_ feature set.

<Code lang="ts" title="iframe-resizer-directive.ts" code={directive} />

## Setup on Parent Page

You can then include it on your parent page as follows, using the [options](/api/parent#options) and 
[events](/api/parent#events) as detailed in the [Parent Page API](/api/parent).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="HTML">
    <Code lang="html" title="parent-page.html" code={html} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="TypeScript">
    <Code lang="ts" title="parent-page.ts" code={ts} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Setting the initial height of the iframe to `100vh` makes the loading in of
the iframe appear smoother to the user, as they will only see the content
below the iframe once it has completed loading and undergone it's initial
sizing.

## Child page

You will then need to install the [@iframe-resizer/child](/setup/child)
package on every page in the iframe.

Once everything is setup, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _iframe-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Advanced Setup](/setup/advanced/) and [Trouble Shooting](/troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.
