This page contains a setup guide for Vue 3. If you are still using version 2 of Vue, then their is
also a guide for creating a simple [Vue 2 Directive](/frameworks/vue2).


## Install

Install this package with the following command.

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/vue" bun />

You will also need to ensure that the [@iframe-resizer/child](/setup/child)
package has been loaded into every page that loads into the iframe.

## Usage

The `<IframeResizer />` component can be passed all`<iframe>` attributes, along with
_[options](/api/parent#options)_ and _[events](/api/parent#events)_ from _iframe-resizer_.
Events need to be in the Vue format `@on-ready(func)`.


```jsx
<IframeResizer
  {iframe attributes}
  {iframe-resizer options}
  {iframe-resizer events}
/>
```

### Typical setup

The normal configuration is to have the iframe resize when the browser window changes
size or the content of the iframe changes. To set this up you need to configure one
of the dimensions of the iframe to a percentage and tell the library to only update
the other dimension. Normally you would set the width to 100% and have the height
scale to fit the content.

```vue
<script setup>
  import IframeResizer from '@iframe-resizer/vue/sfc'
</script>

<template>
  <IframeResizer
    license="xxxx"
    log="collapsed"
    src="http://anotherdomain.com/iframe.html"
    @on-ready="() => console.log('onReady')"
  />
</template>

<style scoped>
  iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  }
</style>
```

Setting the initial height of the iframe to `100vh` makes the loading in of
the iframe appear smoother to the user, as they will only see the content
below the iframe once it has completed loading and undergone it's initial
sizing.

## Child page

You will then need to install the [@iframe-resizer/child](/setup/child)
package on every page in the iframe.

Once everything is setup, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _iframe-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Advanced Setup](/setup/advanced/) and [Trouble Shooting](/troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.
