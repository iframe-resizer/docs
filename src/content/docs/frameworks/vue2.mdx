The following guide describes how to make minimal Vue 2 Directive for use with _iframe-resizer_. 
For Vue 3, it is recommended to use the [Vue3 Component](/frameworks/vue3), 
which provides access to the full _iframe-resizer_ feature set.

## Install Framework API

Install the core _iframe-resizer_ [Framework API](/api/framework) with the following command.

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/core" />



## Create Vue2 Directive

Create the following Vue directive, which will give you basic _iframe-resizer_ functionality.

```js
import Vue from "vue";
import connectResizer from "@iframe-resizer/core";

Vue.directive("iframeResizer", {
  bind: function (el, { value = {} }) {
    connectResizer(value)(el);
  },
  unbind: function (el) {
    el.iframeResizer.disconnect();
  },
});
```

and then include it on your page as follows.

```html
<iframe
  v-iframeResizer
  license='xxxx'
  log="collapsed"
  src="myiframe.html"
  waitForLoad
></iframe>

<style>
iframe {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
}
</style>
 ```

 - Thanks to [Aldebaran Desombergh](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/issues/513#issuecomment-538333854) for this example.
   
Setting the initial height of the iframe to `100vh` makes the loading in of
the iframe appear smoother to the user, as they will only see the content
below the iframe once it has completed loading and undergone it's initial
sizing.

## Child page

You will then need to add the [@iframe-resizer/child](/setup/child)
package on every page in the iframe.

Once everything is setup, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _iframe-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Advanced Setup](/setup/advanced/) and [Trouble Shooting](/troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.
