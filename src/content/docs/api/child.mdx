The Child API is for use on the page contained within the `<iframe>` tag. It is split into three sections. 
[Settings](#settings) contains settings that can be passed when calling iframe-resizer. [Events](#events) are 
triggered by updates to the iframe, or messages from the iframe. [Methods](#methods) allow you to interact with 
_iframe-resizer_ after the initial resizing.

<Aside type="note" title="">
  The features on this page are available in the Professional, Business and Open-source editions.
</Aside>

## Settings

The following Settings can be set from within the iframe page by creating a `window.iframeResizer` object on the page.

```html
<script>
  window.iFrameResizer = {
    targetOrigin: "http://mydomain.com",
  }
</script>
```

With options that can be set in both the parent page and in the iframe, then the setting in the iframe takes preference. 

### offsetSize

```
default: undefined
type:    integer
```

Modify the computed size of the iframe. This is useful if the page in the iframe returns a size value that is 
constantly slightly different to how you want the iframe to be sized. This can be set to a positive or
negative value.

**Note:** Setting this value in the iframe will override any value set in the parent page. Set to `0` to disable
this option in the parent page.

### sizeSelector

```
default: ''
type:    string
```

Use a CSS Selector to specify which element should be used to calculate the content size in the iframe. When the
selector returns multiple elements, all of them are inspected and the largest value returned, every time time the 
page updates or resizes.

Alternatively you can directly add a `data-iframe-size` attribute to an element to achieve the same effect.

### targetOrigin

```
default: '*'
type: string
```

This option allows you to restrict the domain of the parent page, to prevent other sites mimicking your 
parent page. This option is really a last line of defense and you should also setup a 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" target="_blank">Content Security Policy</a> 
on your web server.


## Events

The following events can be included in the [Settings](#settings) object attached to the iframed page.

```html
<script>
  window.iFrameResizer = {
    onReady: () => {
      // your code
    },
  }
</script>
```

### onMessage
```js
onMessage: (message) => void
```

Receive message posted from the parent page with the `iframe.iframeResizer.sendMessage()` method.

### onReady
```js
onReady: () => void
```

This function is called once _iframe-resizer_ has been initialized after receiving a call from the parent 
page. If you need to call any of the following methods during page load, then they should be called from 
this event handler.

## Methods

These methods are available in the iframe via the `window.parentIframe` object. These method should be
contained by a test for the `window.parentIframe` object, in case the page is not loaded inside an iframe. 
For example:

```js
if ("parentIframe" in window) {
  parentIframe.close();
}
```

### autoResize(<span class="args">bool</span>)

Turn autoResizing of the iframe on and off. Returns bool of current state.

### close()

Remove the iframe from the parent page.

### getId()

Returns the ID of the iframe that the page is contained in.

### getParentOrigin()

Returns the [Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) of the parent page.

### getParentProps(<span class="args">callback</span>)

Ask the containing page for its positioning coordinates. You need to provide a callback which receives an 
object with the following read only properties:

```js
{
  // iframe.getBoundingRect()
  iframe: {
    width
    height
    top
    right
    bottom
    left
  },

  // from document.documentElement
  document: {
    scrollWidth
    scrollHeight
  },

  // window.visualViewport
  viewport: {
    width
    height
    offsetLeft
    offsetTop
    pageLeft
    pageTop
    scale
  }
}
```

Your callback function will be recalled when the parent page is scrolled or resized.

This method returns a `disable()` function, that you can call to stop updates from
the parent page. The following example requests the properties from the parent page
and passes a callback that logs them to the console and disables further updates.

```js
function logParentProps() {
  const disableParentProps = 
    parentIframe.getParentProps((parentProps) => {
      disableParentProps()
      console.log('Parent Props:', parentProps)
    })
}
```

### scrollBy(<span class="args">x, y</span>)

Scroll the parent page by the given amount.

### scrollTo(<span class="args">x, y</span>)

Scroll the parent page to the coordinates x and y.

### scrollToOffset(<span class="args">x, y</span>)

Scroll the parent page to the coordinates x and y relative to the position of the iframe.

### sendMessage(<span class="args">message, [targetOrigin]</span>)

Send data to the containing page, `message` can be any data type that can be serialized into JSON. 
The `targetOrigin` option is used to restrict where the message is sent to; to stop an attacker
mimicking your parent page. See the MDN documentation on 
[postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage) for more details.

### resize()

Manually force iframe to resize. If for some reason a change in content size is not detected, this 
method allows you to nudge _iframe-resizer_ to recalculate the page size.
