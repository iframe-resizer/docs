import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import FeedbackComponent from "/src/components/Feelback.astro";

The Parent API is for use on the page containing the `<iframe>` tag. It is split into three sections. 
[Options](#options) contains settings that can be passed when calling iframe-resizer. [Events](#events) 
are triggered by updates to the iframe, or messages from the iframe. [Methods](#methods) allow you to 
interact with _iframe-resizer_ after the initial resizing.

## Options

The following options can be passed to _iframe-resizer_ on the parent page.

### License

```
type:    string
```

**Commercial** Enter the key provided with the [purchased](/pricing) commercial license.

**Open Source** If you are using _iframe-resizer_ on an open-source site or project, then you can use it 
for free under the terms of the [Gnu Public License V3](/gpl). To accept these terms set the license to `GPLv3`.

### bodyBackground

```
default: null
type:    string
```

Override the body background style in the iframe.

### bodyMargin

```
default: null
type:    string || number
```

Override the default body margin style in the iframe. A string can be any valid value for the CSS margin 
attribute, for example '8px 3em'. A number value is converted into px.

### bodyPadding

```
default: null
type:    string || number
```

Override the default body padding style in the iframe. A string can be any valid value for the CSS margin 
attribute, for example '8px 3em'. A number value is converted into px.

### checkOrigin

```
default: true
type:    boolean || array
```

When set to true, only allow incoming messages from the domain listed in the `src` property of the iframe
tag. If your iframe navigates between different domains, ports or protocols; then you will need to provide 
an array of URLs or disable this option.

### direction

```
default: 'vertical'
values: 'horizontal' || 'vertical' || 'none'
```

Set the direction in which you want the iframe to automatically scale to the content size.

<Aside type="tip" title="Horizontal Resizing">
  When setting the direction to `horizontal` it is best to avoid floating or
  positioning elements to the right side of the page, as this can interfere with
  working out the content width.

If you must have elements on the right of the page, then you may need to tell
_iframe-resizer_ which page element to use to calculated the width by adding a `data-iframe-size`
attribute.

</Aside>

### inPageLinks

```
default: false
type:    boolean
```

When enabled in page linking inside the iframe and from the iframe to the parent page will be enabled.

<sup>*</sup> This option is available in the  Professional, Business and Open-source editions.

### offsetSize

```
default: 0
type:    integer
```

Modify the computed size of the iframe. This is useful if the page in the iframe returns a size value 
that is consistently slightly different to how you want the iframe to be sized.

<sup>\*</sup> This value can also be set on a per page basis in the iframe.


### scrolling

```
default: false
type:    boolean | 'omit'
```

Enable scroll bars in iframe.

- **true** applies `scrolling="yes"`
- **false** applies `scrolling="no"`
- **'omit'** applies no `scrolling` attribute to the iframe

### tolerance

```
default: 0
type:    integer
```

Set the number of pixels the iframe content size has to change by, before triggering a resize of the iframe.

<Aside type="caution" title="">
  You should not normally need to use this option, other than for debugging. If the iframe is in a resizing
  loop, then this is an indication that their is an issue in your CSS, which is causing the content to always
  scale to a size larger than the current viewport.
</Aside>

### waitForLoad

```
default: false
type:    boolean
```

By default _iframe-resizer_ sends a message to the iframe as soon as it is called, and then tries again when the
`onload` event of the iframe is triggered. Setting this option to __true__ will disable the first attempt to contact
the iframe and force it to wait for the load event to fire. This is useful with some web frameworks that create the 
iframe after the main webpage has loaded.

### warningTimeout

```
default: 5000
type:    integer
```

Set the number of milliseconds after which a warning is logged if the iframe has not responded. Set to **0** to 
suppress warning messages of this type.

## Events

The following callback events can be passed to _iframe-resizer_ on the parent page, as part of the 
[options](#options) object.

### onClose

```js
onClose: (iframeID) => boolean
```

Called before the iframe is closed via `parentIframe.close()` method. Returning `false` will prevent the iframe 
from closing.

### onClosed

```js
onClosed: (iframeID) => void
```

Called after the iframe is closed via `parentIframe.close()` method.

### onMessage

```js
onMessage: ({ iframe, message }) => void
```

Receives messages posted from the iframe with the `parentIframe.sendMessage()` method.

### onMouseEnter

```js
onMouseEnter: ({ iframe, height, width, type }) => void
```

Function called after the mouse enters the iframe. Passes `messageData` object containing the **iframe**, 
**screenX**, **screenY** and the **type** of event that triggered the callback.

### onMouseLeave

```js
onMouseLeave: ({ iframe, height, width, type }) => void
```

Function called after the mouse leaves the iframe. Passes `messageData` object containing the **iframe**, 
**screenX**, **screenY** and the **type** of event that triggered the callback.

### onReady

```js
onReady: (iframe) => void
```

Called after initial setup.

### onResized

```js
onResized: ({ iframe, height, width, type }) => void
```

Function called after iframe resized. Passes `messageData` object containing the **iframe**, **height**, 
**width** and the **type** of event that triggered the iframe to resize.

### onScroll

```js
onScroll: ({ iframe, top, left, }) => boolean
```

Called before the page is repositioned after a request from the iframe, due to either an in page link, or a direct
request from either [parentIframe.scrollTo()](/api/child#scrolltox-y) or 
[parentIframe.scrollToOffset()](/api/child#scrolltooffsetx-y). If this function returns **false**, it will stop 
the library from repositioning the page, so that you can implement your own custom scrolling instead.

The following example shows how to adjust the scroll point. This can be useful if you have a sticky header on your 
page and you need ensure the target scroll point does not get covered by your header.

```js
const SCROLL_OFFSET = 50

iframeResize({
  onScroll: ({ top, left }) {
    window.scrollTo({
      top: top + SCROLL_OFFSET,
      left,
      behavior: 'auto'
    })

    return false // Stop iframe-resizer scrolling the page
  }
})
```

## Methods

Once the iframe has been initialized, an `iframeResizer` object is bound to it. This has the following methods available.

### disconnect()

Disconnect _iframe-resizer_ from the iframe. This method MUST to be called, before removing an iframe from the page.

### moveToAnchor(<span class="args">anchor</span>)

Move to anchor in the iframe.

### resize()

Tell the iframe to resize itself.

### sendMessage(<span class="args">message, [targetOrigin]</span>)

Send data to the containing page, `message` can be any data type that can be serialized into JSON. The `targetOrigin` 
option is used to restrict where the message is sent to, in case your iframe navigates away to another domain.
